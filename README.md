# Dotfiles

Small configuration files for my personal use.

### install.sh

This script installs the configured dotfiles in this directory into your home folder.
It will interactively check to see if files exist, and prompt you on whether you want
to overwrite them.

Everything is done via symlinks for convenient editing and updates.

### subfolders

- `home/` maps to the home folder.
